                       I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3

this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14

much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22

                                  Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28

accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                          The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                              So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                                                              I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39

voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n86                                                                                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\""
